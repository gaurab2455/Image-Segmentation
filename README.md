# Image-Segmentation
In this project we are given an Image and we can then extract K most dominant colors from it.

## Introduction
- Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple distinct regions containing each pixel(sets of pixels, also known as superpixels) with similar attributes.
 There are different methods and one of the most popular methods is K-Means clustering algorithm.
 
## Industrial Uses of Image segmentation
- Multi-color search is a typical part of color extraction technologies. Through using it, you can conduct more complicated search of colors. This means you can identify complex objects that contain more than one dominant color. It also enables multi-color filtering of image search in databases and websites hosted in a color palette functionality.
- Identify the colors in the foreground and background of an image. In this way, you can remove the background if needed, or unnecessary elements from the foreground. This allows for more flexibility, so you can focus only on the objects on the image, or on the setting behind them.
- It can also be useful for e-commerce sites selling clothes for example, so when a person chooses a product and the color filter we can show other similar products with similar colors
